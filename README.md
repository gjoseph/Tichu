Tichu
=====

This is an implementation of the Tichu game. It currently consists of a model module, which models the game and rules,
but will (one day...) offer a REST API, and possibly client(s). I'm hoping to be able to play around with cross-compilation
of the model code to re-use it in clients (e.g Javascript)

For information about the original game, see https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/215/tichu or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tichu.
