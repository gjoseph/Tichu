# description: |
#  Somewhere in the depths of UpgradeToJava21 via Java8toJava11, dependencies
#  to jakarta.annotation:jakarta.annotation-api are added because we used
#  javax.annotation..*. We only ever used  @Nonnull and @Nullable, which are
#  _not_ in this jar, so that wasn't helpful.
#  Since individual recipes can't be disabled when they're declared within
#  others, so we previously had a RemoveDependency recipe to remove it.
#  See https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/discussions/4211
#  We don't use any javax or jakarta annotations anymore, so this is moot.
