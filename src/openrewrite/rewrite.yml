description: |
  Somewhere in the depths of UpgradeToJava21 via Java8toJava11,
  dependencies to jakarta.annotation:jakarta.annotation-api are
  added because we use javax.annotation..*. Except, we only use
  @Nonnull and @Nullable, which are _not_ in this jar. Since
  individual recipes can't be disabled when they're declared
  within others, here's a recipe that does the inverse.
  See https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/discussions/4211

      groupId: jakarta.annotation
