# General format:
# Comments are allowed
# Action is on one line
# Recognised by certain keywords
# Game - expects certain events in order: create table, join team, ...
# These actions might well be the same action objects used by clients
# - postActionCommands are directives that are "attached" to the previous actions
# - postActionCommands can be expectations or debug output
# Certain actions are only available in "test" or "cheat" mode, such that this text interface is actually
# usable in real clients.
# If no expectation is specified, we expect the action to be successful

init game of 4 # at some point we might support different rules (nr of players, target score, ...)
